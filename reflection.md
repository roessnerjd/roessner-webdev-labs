## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to get the first three exercises figured out. The form exercise was more difficult.
I had referenced the videos to see if I did well on the exercises, and to help me finish
the remaining assignments. The most helpful exercises were the form and semantics exercises. 
Overall, I think all of the exercises were helpful in retaining this week's content. 

### Accessibility

This one was easier because we already had practice with the forms before. I also added
a few extras that were not a part of the video. This included creating a fieldset for both
sections and also adding a main/section area. I also added "aria-labelledby" for better
accessibility. I checked with the video after I was done to make sure I had done everything
correctly. Now looking back at this reflection, I realize the aria labels are more for things
that are not inherently semantic. I didn't have much difficulty with the exercises. All were
helpful in retaining the information.

### CSS

For the first week of CSS, it was more difficult than the last two. I almost finished the 5th,
but couldn't start the 6th. The video playlist helped me get started and finish the lab work. 
I also changed my work for the first portion. I had listed more code that wasn't necessary. I
think that including more exercises might help better understand CSS, but that's really just
practice makes perfect. There are so many different things you can change too, so it is hard 
to decide which is best. 

### JavaScript

I had the most difficulty in this section. I've never used JS before, so it was hard to 
understand. After going through the playlist/slides, it made it much easier to understand.
However, I think it will take more time to be more comfortable with JS. I would say the best
exercises were the objects, the dom, and the fetch exercises. I would have like to practice
more with this, but I think it was a great introduction. I had to use the video playlist
and the material covered in class to have a better understanding of what was going on. 

### JQuery

Overall, this wasn't too difficult to understand. I prefer the vanilla code more just because
it is more straightforward. I do see the benefits of using jQuery though. Both exercises were 
helpful in understanding how to use jQuery. I did both exercises slightly differently than the
playlist. I used the playlist to check my work. It would be great to get more practice, but 
there is only so much you can fit into 10 weeks.
