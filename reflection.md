## Reflection Document

### HTML

The first three programs were easy to figure out. The form program was more difficult.
I imagine I could of referenced the material provided to figure it out, but I decided
to use the video as help. I'll most likely use references to figure out how to code it. 
Most programs gave an "alert" warning because there was no header. The form program was
also the most helpful. I found it informative and learned more about how to properly do 
forms. 

### Accessibility

This one was more easy because we already had practice with the forms before. I also added
a few extras that were not a part of the video. This included creating a fieldset for both
sections and also adding a main/section area. I also added "aria-labelledby" for better
accessibility. I checked with the video after I was done to make sure I had done everything
correctly.
