## Reflection Document

### HTML

The first three programs were easy to figure out. The form program was more difficult.
I imagine I could of referenced the material provided to figure it out, but I decided
to use the video as help. I'll most likely use references to figure out how to code it. 
Most programs gave an "alert" warning because there was no header. The form program was
also the most helpful. I found it informative and learned more about how to properly do 
forms.
